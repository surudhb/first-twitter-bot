# Twitter Bot

* To run: `npm start`

# Features

* Tweets a random word every day with a gif from giphy associated with it
* Alternates tweeting a joke and a dad joke every 2 hours (will likely change this interval since not that many jokes exist)

# TODOs

* Word of the day with giphy and random-word-api
* Deployment to Heroku

# Goals

* Exposure to Node.js and helper packages
* Using an actual API
* Introduction to promises and chaining multiple API calls
* Fight boredom during lockdown #COVID19
